About Dataset
Dataset Overview
This dataset is about students and their physical health, mental health, and academic performance. It looks at how college students handle health problems when they are under a lot of stress, such as when studying for exams or starting their own businesses. The dataset is designed to help create computer programs that can predict when college students are likely to face health issues due to stress or physical strain. It includes data from devices that track students' activities and self-reported information about their lives and habits.

Key Features
Demographic Information
This section contains details about the students, including:

Age: How old the students are.
Gender: Whether they are male or female.
Unique Identifier: A special number assigned to each student to help identify them.
This information is helpful for understanding who the students are and distinguishing between them in the dataset.

Physiological Data
This part includes information gathered from the students' bodies using special sensors. The main metrics we look at are:

Heart Rate: The number of heartbeats per minute. A higher heart rate can indicate that a student is stressed or physically active.

Blood Pressure: This has two readings:

Systolic Pressure: The pressure when the heart beats.

Diastolic Pressure: The pressure when the heart rests between beats. These readings help assess how well a student's heart is functioning.

Stress Levels: This metric helps to gauge how stressed a student is at a given time. Understanding stress levels is important as they can reveal whether a student feels overwhelmed and can provide insights into their overall physical health.

Psychological Data
This information is gathered directly from the students themselves and includes:

Self-Reported Stress Levels: Ratings from students about how stressed they feel, providing insight into their mental health.
Mood States: Reports on their emotions, such as feeling happy, stressed, or neutral. This information helps us understand the student's emotional well-being.
Academic and Entrepreneurial Activity
This section looks at how students spend their time on various tasks, including:

Academic Tasks: Hours spent studying and completing assignments. These tasks are crucial for achieving good grades.

Entrepreneurial Projects: Time dedicated to business ventures or startups. This information shows how students manage their workload and time.

Physical Activity and Sleep Quality
Both physical activity and sleep quality are essential for overall health. This section includes:

Daily Physical Activity: Information about how much exercise or movement students engage in each day. Regular physical activity is vital for maintaining good health.

Sleep Quality: Metrics that indicate how well students sleep. Both physical activity and quality sleep are important for overall well-being.

Health Risk Level
This feature categorizes students into health risk groups:

Low Health Risk: Indicates that the student is likely healthy, with no apparent health issues.

Moderate Health Risk: Suggests that there are some concerns that may need to be addressed.

High Health Risk: Implies that the student may be facing serious health challenges.

Family Members
This feature provides a count of how many family members each student has. This information can indicate the level of support a student has at home, which is essential for understanding their overall situation.

Purpose of the Dataset
This dataset serves multiple important purposes:

Research: It helps researchers understand how stress affects college students' health, especially in academic and entrepreneurial environments.

Predictive Models: This data can be used to create models that predict which students are at risk of developing health problems. This is crucial for identifying students in need of support.

Educators and support services can use this dataset to develop plans to assist students in managing stress and improving their well-being. By analyzing this information, support services can better understand how to help students thrive during high-stress periods.

Overall, the dataset aims to provide valuable insights into the health and well-being of college students, especially during challenging times.

About this file
This dataset focuses on college students' physical health, mental health, and academic performance, specifically examining how they handle stress during exams or when starting new businesses. It includes information from devices that track students' activities and self-reported details about their lives. Key features consist of demographic information like age and gender, physiological data such as heart rate and blood pressure, and psychological data including self-reported stress levels and emotional states. It also captures academic and entrepreneurial activities, measuring hours spent on studying and business projects, as well as physical activity and sleep quality. The health risk level categorizes students into low, moderate, or high risk, while the family members feature indicates how many family members each student has, highlighting their support system. Overall, this dataset assists researchers in predicting potential health issues in students under stress and provides valuable information for support services to help them.
