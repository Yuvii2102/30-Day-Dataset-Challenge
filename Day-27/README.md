## 📌 Dataset Description

This dataset contains daily weather data.

Goal:
Predict the weather condition using:

- Precipitation
- Maximum temperature
- Minimum temperature
- Wind speed

Weather types:

- Drizzle
- Rain
- Sun
- Snow
- Fog

---

## 📊 Type of Data

Structured dataset  
Time-series weather data (2012–2015)  

---

## 🤖 ML Concept

Machine Learning – Multi-Class Classification  

We predict:
- Rain
- Sun
- Snow
- Drizzle
- Fog  

---

## 🎯 Target Column

weather

---

## 📥 Input Features

- precipitation → Amount of rainfall/snow
- temp_max → Maximum temperature
- temp_min → Minimum temperature
- wind → Wind speed

---

## 📤 Output

Predicted Weather Type:
- drizzle
- rain
- sun
- snow
- fog

---

## 🧠 What We Learned

- High precipitation → Rain or Snow
- Very low temperature → Snow
- Zero precipitation + high temp → Sun
- Moderate wind + light rain → Drizzle
- Temperature range affects weather type
